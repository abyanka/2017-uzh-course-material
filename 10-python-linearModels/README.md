# Module:  Scientfic Python - Linear Econometric Models in Python

## Meta-Information

*   Module Maintainer: Lachlan Deer (`@lachlandeer`)
*   Course: [Programming Practices for Research in Economics](https://github.com/pp4rs)
*   Institute: Dept of Economics, Uni Zurich

## Contents

We introduce how to run linear econometric methods using Python.
As an example data set, we use the seminal paper by:

        Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson (2001), The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation,
        American Economic Review, 91, December 2001: pp. 1369-1401.

The paper in full is available ungated [here](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4123)

### What we cover

*   Linear Regression (OLS)
*   Instrumental Varaibles (IV)
*   Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors (`HC1`)

### Dependencies:
We use the following python libraries:
*   `statsmodels`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `linearmodels`

## Acknowledgements

At some points we borrow heavily from the QuantEcon lesson `Linear Regression with Python` which is available [here](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/ols.html).
