    "The internet is an esssential source of information for empirical research projects in economics. Retrieving information stored on the web can be as simple as downloading a csv file that is hosted online. However, we will be discussing slightly more interesting versions, where the data can be accessed directly within your browser, via an Application Programming Interface (API) or where they are embedded in a website and we want to extract them. The latter is called *web scraping*. \n",
    "\n",
    "While copy pasting information from the browesr and using an API is fairly standardized, the real trick of web scraping is that there is no silver bullet. Any web scraping procedure will work only with the page it was designed for. These notes will cover a few general approaches which can be used, but if you are scraping your own data, you will often need to start from scratch, figure out which method is appropriate, and implement it.\n",

    "The coding requirements in these notes start easy and will gradually become more demanding. We will cover the following web scraping techniques\n",

    "No, this isn’t a joke. If the data is in a clean table, and small enough that you can hightlight it all, copying and pasting often produces a text document that can be read in easily. For example, Wikipedia tables are easy to approach this way. Consider the list of nominal GDP by countries according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)). If you highlight one of the tables, paste it in a plaintext editor such as Atom, you could load with\n"

    "An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set methods to access data which is not publically available as a complete data set. For example, if you wanted to get access to Google search results, you’d use the [Google JSON/Atom Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview) or if you wanted to get a list of Yelp businesses, you’d use the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers). These are most commonly used by programmers (e.g. if you use any third-party apps to connect to resources such as Facebook, Twitter, etc; the developers of those apps use APIs to access your information) but are also useful to extract data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of APIs are private - either they’re only available to people who are authorized to use them, or they’re used internally by development teams. However, a good number are public, but may require purchasing access or at least registering to get an API key. There’s a useful list of [public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) maintained by Todd Motto. A lot of the truely open APIs are done by fans and volunteers as opposed to the official company released ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rate Limits\n",
    "Note that a lot of API’s have rate limits - the number of requests you can send in a particular window of time (e.g. 100 requests per hour). Before spending a lot of time scraping, make sure you know the rate limit and structure your requests appropriately. You may need to space your scraping out over a couple of days.\n",

    "### The Components of a Webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit a web page, your web browser makes a request to a web server. This request is called a GET request, since we’re getting files from the server. The server then sends back files that tell our browser how to render the page for you. The files fall into a few main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML -- contain the main content of the page\n",
    "* CSS -- add styling to make the page look nicer\n",
    "* JS -- Javascript files add interactivity to web pages\n",
    "* Images -- image formats, such as JPG and PNG allow web pages to show pictures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Primer in HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "After your browser receives all the files, it renders the page and displays it to you. There’s a lot that happens behind the scenes to render a page nicely, but we don’t need to worry about most of it when we’re web scraping. When we perform web scraping, we’re interested in the main content of the web page, so we look at the HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Note that HTML is not a programming lanuage (like Python) but a markup language that tells a browser how to layout content. HTML allows you to do similar things to what you do in a word processor like Microsoft Word – make text bold, create paragraphs, and so on. Because HTML isn’t a programming language, it isn’t nearly as complex as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML consists of elements called tags. All HTML pages (at least all well-formatted ones) are surrounded by opening and cloing `<html> </html>` tags, with `<head>` and `<body>` tags in between. Other tags populate these page headers and page bodies to form the structure and content of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the page title (this is the text that is seen in a tab in your browser) is \"A Useful Page\" and the first header \"An Interesting Title\" is contained in the `<h1>` tag. Immediately below that is a `div` (\"divider\") tag of the class \"body\", containing what might be a main article or longer piece of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the `head` and `body` tags are inside the `html` tag. In HTML, tags are nested, and can go inside other tags. Tags have commonly used names that depend on their position in relation to other tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `child` -- a child is a tag inside another tag. So the `div` tag above is a child of the `body` tag\n",
    "* `parent` – a parent is the tag another tag is inside. Above, the `html` tag is the parent of the `body` tag.\n",
    "* `sibiling` – a sibiling is a tag that is nested inside the same parent as another tag. For example, `head` and `body` are siblings, since they’re both inside `html`. `h1` and `div` are siblings, since they’re both inside `body`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tags above are extremely common html tags. Here are a few others:\n",
    "\n",
    "* p -- creates a paragraph\n",
    "* a -- renders a link to another webpage; it often comes with the `href` property that determines where the link goes\n",
    "* table – creates a table\n",
    "* form – creates an input form\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a full list of HTML tags [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into actual web scraping, let’s learn about the `class` and `id` properties. These special properties give HTML elements names, and make them easier to interact with when we’re scraping. One element can have multiple classes, and a class can be shared between elements. Each element can only have one id, and an id can only be used once on a page. Classes and ids are optional, and not all elements will have them. They do not change how the tags are rendered. "

    "## 4. Scraping Dynamic Webpages with Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is, by far, the most common and most well-supported client-side scripting language on the Web today. It can be used to collect information for user tracking, submit forms without reloading the page, embed multimedia, and even power entire online games. Even deceptively simple-looking pages can often contain multiple pieces of JavaScript. You can find it embedded between `<script>` tags in the page’s source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### AJAX and Dynamic HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever submitted a form or retrieved information from a server without reloading the page, you’ve likely used a website that uses Ajax. Ajax stands for *Asynchronous JavaScript and XML*, and it is a group of technologies used to send information to and receive from a web server without making a separate page request. Like Ajax, dynamic HTML or DHTML is a collection of technologies used for a common purpose. DHTML is HTML code, CSS language, or both that change due to client-side scripts changing HTML elements on the page. A button might appear only after the user moves the cursor, a background color might change on a click, or an Ajax request might trigger a new block of content to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although the word “dynamic” is generally associated with words like “moving,” or “changing,” the presence of interactive HTML components, moving images, or embedded media does not necessarily make a page DHTML, even though it might look dynamic. In addition, some of the most boring, static-looking pages on the Internet can have DHTML processes running behind the scenes that depend on the use of JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you scrape a large number of different websites, you will soon run into a situation in which the content you are viewing in your browser does not match the content you see in the source code you’re retrieving from the site. You might view the output of your scraper and scratch your head, trying to figure out where everything you’re seeing on the exact same page in your browser has disappeared to. The web page might also have a loading page that appears to redirect you to another page of results, but you’ll notice that the page’s URL never changes when this redirect happens. Both of these are caused by a failure of your scraper to execute the JavaScript that is making the magic happen on the page. Without the JavaScript, the HTML just sort of sits there, and the site might look very different than what it looks like in your web browser, which executes the JavaScript without problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Executing JavaScript in Python with Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium is a powerful web scraping tool developed originally for website testing. These days it’s also used when the accurate portrayal of websites — as they appear in a browser — is required. Selenium works by automating browsers to load the website, retrieve the required data, and even take screenshots or assert that certain actions happen on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium does not contain its own web browser; it requires integration with third- party browsers in order to run. If you were to run Selenium with Firefox, for example, you would literally see a Firefox instance open up on your screen, navigate to the website, and perform the actions you had specified in the code. Although this might be neat to watch, I prefer my scripts to run quietly in the background, so I use a tool called PhantomJS in lieu of an actual browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "PhantomJS is what is known as a “headless” browser. It loads websites into memory and executes JavaScript on the page, but does it without any graphic rendering of the website to the user. By combining Selenium with PhantomJS, you can run an extremely powerful web scraper that handles cookies, JavaScript, headers, and every‐ thing else you need with ease.\n",
    "You can download the Selenium library from its website or use a third-party installer such as pip to install it from the command line.\n",
    "PhantomJS can be downloaded from its website. Because PhantomJS is a full (albeit headless) browser and not a Python library, it does require a download and installa‐ tion to use and cannot be installed with pip.\n",
    "Although there are plenty of pages that use Ajax to load data (notably Google), I’ve created a sample page at http://pythonscraping.com/pages/javascript/ajaxDemo.html to run our scrapers against. This page contains some sample text, hardcoded into the page’s HTML, that is replaced by Ajax-generated content after a two-second delay. If we were to scrape this page’s data using traditional methods, we’d only get the loading page, without actually getting the data that we want.\n",
    "The Selenium library is an API called on the a *WebDriver*. The WebDriver is a bit like a browser in that it can load websites, but it can also be used like a BeautifulSoup object to find page elements, interact with elements on the page (send text, click, etc.), and do other actions to drive the web scrapers.\n",
