# Module:  Scientfic Python - Getting to know Arrays with NumPy

## Meta-Information

*   Module Maintainer: Lachlan Deer (`@lachlandeer`)
*   Course: [Programming Practices for Research in Economics](https://github.com/pp4rs)
*   Institute: Dept of Economics, Uni Zurich
*   Current Version: [Fall 2017 edition](https://pp4rs.github.io/2017-uzh)

## Contents

This module aims to get us familar with the basic element of Scientific computing - the array.
We use NumPy to:

*   Create arrays
*   Index, slice, and reshape arrays
*   Compute using ufuncs
*   Compute aggregate features of an array
*   Import and export arrays from a file
*   Broadcast arrays onto each other
*   Index and extract data using Boolean Logic and Boolean Masks
*   Index arrays with Fancy Indexing
*   Sort arrays and partitions of arrays
