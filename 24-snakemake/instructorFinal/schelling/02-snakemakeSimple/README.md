# A Simple Snakefile for the Schelling Model

* Main Contributor: Lachlan Deer (@ldeer)

## What this directory does

* We adapt the bash workflow in `01-bashPipeline` that executes a series of scripts that builds some analysis of the Schelling Model to and `Snakefile` using the elementary operations from the tutorial.
* A more complete solution that utilizes subworkflows and config files can be found in `03-snakemakeComplete`
