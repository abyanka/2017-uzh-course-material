# Run Text Analysis Pipeline with Bash Script

* lead contributor: Lachlan Deer (@ldeer)

## What we do

* For texts in `src/data` we count the word frequencies using `src/analysis/wordcount.py`,
* Plot the resulting word counts using `src/analysis/plotcount.py`
* Examine whether most occuring word in each text appears twice as often as the second most, i.e 'test' Zipf's Law using `src/analysis/zipf_test.py`
